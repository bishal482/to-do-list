This iss a complete To-Do List Web Application called LIST-IFY that helps users manage their tasks efficiently by allowing them to add, prioritize, edit, and delete tasks.
It is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with functionality to dynamically update the task list and support a light/dark theme toggle for better usability.

The To-Do List application was enhanced to include persistent data storage using localStorage, allowing tasks and their states (completed or pending) to persist even after the browser is closed or refreshed.
An Edit Task feature was added, enabling users to modify tasks in line with an Edit and Save button, ensuring changes are saved to localStorage.
A Task Filtering feature was implemented with a dropdown to display all, completed, or pending tasks dynamically.
The UI was improved with a distinct background color for completed tasks, a theme toggle for light/dark mode accessibility, and a responsive design for better usability on various screen sizes. 
These enhancements ensure a more functional, user-friendly, and visually appealing application.
